<ul>
<li>
bad security has economic and privacy consequences, and security bugs impacts user experience. 

<li>
Secure code is often good code. Easy to reason about - easier to maintain - has less (other) bugs.

<li>
Security is not a feature - has to be assigned for the first second you think about a program.

<li>
How to produce secure code: understanding - the underlying systems, the problem domain and what the pitfalls and footguns are.

<li>
<em>Design with security in mind</em>  <em>Plan for failure</em>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Writing secure software: software design, access control, authentication

Common vulnerabilities: buffer overflows, SQL injection, XSS

<p>
Example: A login page can be correct, but still fail to secure the website.

<div id="First Lecture - Software security-Programs"><h2 id="Programs" class="header"><a href="#First Lecture - Software security-Programs">Programs</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Executable file: programs can be created from source code in different ways.

<li>
Process: the operating system (OS) manages the different processes running. Each process has:

<ul>
<li>
a process ID (which identifies the process)

<li>
a (virtual) memory space

<li>
a lot of other metadata(UID, PID, file descriptors,...)

<li>
How the memory space is managed is called the /runtime environment/, and depends on the computer

<li>
In particular, the OS does not know about:

<li>
Variables

<li>
types

<li>
objects

<li>
scopes

<li>
functions

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="First Lecture - Software security-Runtime environment"><h2 id="Runtime environment" class="header"><a href="#First Lecture - Software security-Runtime environment">Runtime environment</a></h2></div>
<div id="First Lecture - Software security-Runtime environment-Difference between C and Java"><h3 id="Difference between C and Java" class="header"><a href="#First Lecture - Software security-Runtime environment-Difference between C and Java">Difference between C and Java</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
C - very thin abstraction over the OS model of a process, Java provides a more robust abstraction. Java guarantee: memory safety

</ul>

<div id="First Lecture - Software security-Runtime environment-Processes interacting with the environment"><h3 id="Processes interacting with the environment" class="header"><a href="#First Lecture - Software security-Runtime environment-Processes interacting with the environment">Processes interacting with the environment</a></h3></div>
<p>
Processes make system calls to interact with the world beyond its memory space
</p>
<ul>
<li>
read / write to files

<li>
network access

<li>
time functions

<li>
inter-process communication

</ul>

<p>
The OS receives the call and executes the action on behalf of the process.
