<div id="Third lecture - Towards thread models-The meaning of secure software"><h2 id="The meaning of secure software" class="header"><a href="#Third lecture - Towards thread models-The meaning of secure software">The meaning of secure software</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
etymology: without risk, riskfree

<ul>
<li>
not useful as definition, since its negative

</ul>
<li>
<em>DEF:</em> /software security is the ability to function according to intentions in an adverserial environment/

<ul>
<li>
Adverserial environment: our program is only a small part of the bigger sea, the adverserial environment.

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Third lecture - Towards thread models-Examples of assumptions"><h2 id="Examples of assumptions" class="header"><a href="#Third lecture - Towards thread models-Examples of assumptions">Examples of assumptions</a></h2></div>
<div id="Third lecture - Towards thread models-Examples of assumptions-Assumptions pointing towards problems:"><h3 id="Assumptions pointing towards problems:" class="header"><a href="#Third lecture - Towards thread models-Examples of assumptions-Assumptions pointing towards problems:">Assumptions pointing towards problems:</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
user input cannot be trusted to have property X

<li>
IP addresses can be spoofed

<li>
Computer resources are finite

<li>
Programmers write bugs

</ul>

<div id="Third lecture - Towards thread models-Examples of assumptions-Assumptions pointing towards solutions:"><h3 id="Assumptions pointing towards solutions:" class="header"><a href="#Third lecture - Towards thread models-Examples of assumptions-Assumptions pointing towards solutions:">Assumptions pointing towards solutions:</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
if the program checks the input, we know it has property X

<li>
an attacker cannot guess a random 128 bit number

<li>
the semantics of the program

<li>
the type checker is correct

<li>
internet routing is quite robust

</ul>

<div id="Third lecture - Towards thread models-Sequrity requirements"><h2 id="Sequrity requirements" class="header"><a href="#Third lecture - Towards thread models-Sequrity requirements">Sequrity requirements</a></h2></div>
<p>
Examples of requirements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
availability of the service

<li>
capacity

<li>
integrity of data

<li>
authenticity of data

<li>
recoverability

</ul>

<div id="Third lecture - Towards thread models-Sequrity mechanisms"><h2 id="Sequrity mechanisms" class="header"><a href="#Third lecture - Towards thread models-Sequrity mechanisms">Sequrity mechanisms</a></h2></div>
<p>
Examples of mechanisms:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
choice of programming languages

<li>
rate limiting

<li>
sanity checks on user inputs

<li>
access control lists

<li>
optimisaton of algorithms

<li>
encryption

</ul>

<div id="Third lecture - Towards thread models-Software security"><h2 id="Software security" class="header"><a href="#Third lecture - Towards thread models-Software security">Software security</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Put together we get: assumptions + security mechanism = sequrity requirements

</ul>

<div id="Third lecture - Towards thread models-Threat model"><h2 id="Threat model" class="header"><a href="#Third lecture - Towards thread models-Threat model">Threat model</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
the threat model explicates our assumptions about the system:

<ul>
<li>
what threats applies to each component?

<li>
what are the trust relationships betweeen components?

<li>
which threats apply to each relationship?

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Third lecture - Towards thread models-Threat model-Example:"><h3 id="Example:" class="header"><a href="#Third lecture - Towards thread models-Threat model-Example:">Example:</a></h3></div>
<p>
Most transport encryption has requirements: confidentiability, integrity, authenticity. And assumptions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
attacker can read the messages when passing between sender and recipient

<li>
attacker cannot access messages after decryption

</ul>
<p>
Either:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
attacker cannot alter messages (passive attacker)

<li>
attacker can alter messages (active attacker)

</ul>

<div id="Third lecture - Towards thread models-Threat model-Functional decomposition"><h3 id="Functional decomposition" class="header"><a href="#Third lecture - Towards thread models-Threat model-Functional decomposition">Functional decomposition</a></h3></div>
<p>
For a specific program or system, a functional decomposition will help identify threats and clarify the relationship between different pieces of the system
