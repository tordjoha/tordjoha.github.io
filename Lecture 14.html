<p>
The privacy paradox: Many users say that they value their privacy, but they act in ways which endanger their privacy. (For instance by sharing a lot of information on Facebook)
</p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>
The users are not aware of the privacy implications of their actions. For instance, because of lack of technical understanding.

Social pressure to share (impression management).

EU directive:

<ul>
<li>
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

</ul>
<li>
Norwegian law:

<ul>
<li>
Personopplysningsloven av 2018 incorporates GDPR into Norwegian law.

<div id="14th Lecture - Privacy-Legal protection-GDPR"><h3 id="GDPR" class="header"><a href="#14th Lecture - Privacy-Legal protection-GDPR">GDPR</a></h3></div>
<p>
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is an EU directive which came into effect 25th of May 2018.
Specifies:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
the rights of individuals and

<li>
the obligations of data processors.

</ul>
<p>
More specific than the 1995 directive it replaces.
</p>

<p>
Where to find information?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The GDPR law: while the GDPR is a law text, its language is quite clear.

<li>
Datatilsynet has both explainations of the law, and examples of how this is implemented in specific cases.

</ul>

<p>
<span id="14th Lecture - Privacy-Legal protection-GDPR-Fundamental principles:"></span><strong id="Fundamental principles:">Fundamental principles:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The fundamental principles for data processing according to GDPR:

<ul>
<li>
Lawfulness

<li>
Fairness

<li>
Transparency

</ul>
<li>
Terms used: “data subject”, “controller” and “processor”.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Article 6: Lawfulness

<li>
Article 9: Special categories of data

</ul>

<div id="14th Lecture - Privacy-Legal protection-Separating necessary from optional"><h3 id="Separating necessary from optional" class="header"><a href="#14th Lecture - Privacy-Legal protection-Separating necessary from optional">Separating necessary from optional</a></h3></div>
<p>
When processing data, one should separate between:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Data collected based on optional consent

<li>
Data necessary to provide the given service

</ul>

<div id="14th Lecture - Privacy-Legal protection-Minimise data collection"><h3 id="Minimise data collection" class="header"><a href="#14th Lecture - Privacy-Legal protection-Minimise data collection">Minimise data collection</a></h3></div>
<p>
As developers of software:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Do not collect data you do not need.

<li>
Keep the data only as log as you need:

<ul>
<li>
Example: Delete shipping data once package is shipped.

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="14th Lecture - Privacy-Legal protection-What constitutes consent?"><h3 id="What constitutes consent?" class="header"><a href="#14th Lecture - Privacy-Legal protection-What constitutes consent?">What constitutes consent?</a></h3></div>

Formulated:

<ul>
<li>
in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.

<li>
Must be specific to each kind of data

<li>
Must be possible to withdraw 

<li>
Not sufficient: Prefilled checkboxes

<li>
Not sufficient: Checkbox with -&gt; I agree to the terms.

</ul>

<p>
One technical solution: keep separate fields in database, for each consent.
</p>

<div id="14th Lecture - Privacy-Legal protection-Aquiring consent"><h3 id="Aquiring consent" class="header"><a href="#14th Lecture - Privacy-Legal protection-Aquiring consent">Aquiring consent</a></h3></div>
<p>
As developers of software: Define clearly what kind of data the service collects/aggregates/disseminates.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Divide into categories.

<li>
Ask for consent for each category upon registration of a user.

<li>
Store the separate consent as fields in database.

<li>
Make an interface for changing consent settings.

<li>
No prefilled checkboxes.

</ul>
<p>
Not enough to have “I accept these terms”. . .
</p>

<div id="14th Lecture - Privacy-Legal protection-Fairness"><h3 id="Fairness" class="header"><a href="#14th Lecture - Privacy-Legal protection-Fairness">Fairness</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
Minimal requirement: Allow user to:

<ul>
<li>
see the data in their profile.

<li>
request manual rectification.

</ul>
<li>
More useful to have a fully automated process.

</ul>

<li>
Restricted to search results deemed either:

<ul>
<li>
incorrect or

As software developers: The service should have a method which takes a UserID and deletes personal data attached to it.

<li>
Easy enough to delete a record in a DB

<li>
More difficult with foreign keys to this object.

<li>
Even more difficult with hash-chain/tamper-evident data structures.

<li>
How about restoration from backup?

<li>
Notify third parties of erasure.

<p>
As software developers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you want to do statistical analysis on your users data, consider hashing+salting, or better use a KDF, on UserID to pseudonymise the data before processing.

<li>
Important if using third-party service for analysis.

<li>
Reversable if you keep the salt.

Non-reversable if salt is deleted.
