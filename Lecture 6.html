<p>
Access control decides which users can
</p>
<ul>
<li>
read/write to objects

<li>
perform operations

<li>
grant / revoke access

</ul>

<p>
We are studying logical aspects of access control.
</p>

<div id="Sixth Lecture - Access control-Logical aspects"><h2 id="Logical aspects" class="header"><a href="#Sixth Lecture - Access control-Logical aspects">Logical aspects</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
An access control system consists of: subjects, objects and actions

<li>
and a model for how to relate these things (permissions)

</ul>

<div id="Sixth Lecture - Access control-Two axes of access control"><h2 id="Two axes of access control" class="header"><a href="#Sixth Lecture - Access control-Two axes of access control">Two axes of access control</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
classified according to:

<ul>
<li>
mandatory / discretionary

<li>
permission model:

<ul>
<li>
access control list

<li>
role based

<li>
capability based

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Models are equivalent staticially, but have different dynamic behaviors.
</p>

<div id="Sixth Lecture - Access control-Discretionary and mandatory"><h2 id="Discretionary and mandatory" class="header"><a href="#Sixth Lecture - Access control-Discretionary and mandatory">Discretionary and mandatory</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
In a mandatory access control system: the access control policies are fixed by a central authority

<li>
In a discretionary access control system a subject who has access to an object can specify permissions for it or transfer access to another actor

</ul>

<p>
 Modern operating systems have mandatory access control on resources such as CPU, memory and storage.

<ul>
<li>
permissions are assigned to objects

<li>
each object has a list of permissions assigned to different users

</ul>

<div id="Sixth Lecture - Access control-Access control models-Role based access control"><h3 id="Role based access control" class="header"><a href="#Sixth Lecture - Access control-Access control models-Role based access control">Role based access control</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
a set of roles abstrac the permissions from users

<li>
we have sets P(permissions), R(Roles) and U(Users)

<li>
actions arae always performed by a role. To change role user must reauthenticate.

</ul>

<div id="Sixth Lecture - Access control-Access control models-Capability based access control"><h3 id="Capability based access control" class="header"><a href="#Sixth Lecture - Access control-Access control models-Capability based access control">Capability based access control</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
users have capabilities

<li>
a capability consists of:

<ul>
<li>
a <span id="Sixth Lecture - Access control-Access control models-Capability based access control-reference"></span><strong id="reference">reference</strong> to an object

<li>
a set of <span id="Sixth Lecture - Access control-Access control models-Capability based access control-permissions"></span><strong id="permissions">permissions</strong> for that object

</ul>
<li>
a capability is used whenever a resouce is accessed.

</ul>
