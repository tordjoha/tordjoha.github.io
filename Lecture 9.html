<div id="9th Lecture - Code constructs for security-Immutability"><h2 id="Immutability" class="header"><a href="#9th Lecture - Code constructs for security-Immutability">Immutability</a></h2></div>
<p>
An object is <em>immutable</em> if it cannot be changed after creation.
</p>



<div id="9th Lecture - Code constructs for security-Immutability-Why are Strings immutable in Java?"><h3 id="Why are Strings immutable in Java?" class="header"><a href="#9th Lecture - Code constructs for security-Immutability-Why are Strings immutable in Java?">Why are Strings immutable in Java?</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Because of string intering: every copy of a string is stored only once

<li>
Allows memoization of hashcode (for say HashMap)

<ul>
<li>
Since the string doesn't change, we never have to recompute the hashcode.

</ul>
<li>
Thread safety: if object doesn't change, its safe to access it through different threads

<li>
Security: not throwing around permissions for other functions to change something

</ul>

<div id="9th Lecture - Code constructs for security-Immutability-The problem of mutation"><h3 id="The problem of mutation" class="header"><a href="#9th Lecture - Code constructs for security-Immutability-The problem of mutation">The problem of mutation</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
If you pass reference to a mutable object, you give permission to mutate the object.

<li>
If you receive a reference to a mutable object, you must accept that if mutates beyond your control.

</ul>

<div id="9th Lecture - Code constructs for security-Immutability-Immutable objects"><h3 id="Immutable objects" class="header"><a href="#9th Lecture - Code constructs for security-Immutability-Immutable objects">Immutable objects</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Passing a reference only gives "read access"

<li>
When receiving a reference, you can safely test for invariants

<li>
Thread safety for free!

</ul>

<div id="9th Lecture - Code constructs for security-Immutability in Java"><h2 id="Immutability in Java" class="header"><a href="#9th Lecture - Code constructs for security-Immutability in Java">Immutability in Java</a></h2></div>

<p>
The <em>final</em> keyword for variables mean:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The reference cannot be changed after initialisation

<li>
Any constructor must initialise the field

</ul>

<div id="9th Lecture - Code constructs for security-Immutability in Java-Immutable classes"><h3 id="Immutable classes" class="header"><a href="#9th Lecture - Code constructs for security-Immutability in Java-Immutable classes">Immutable classes</a></h3></div>
<p>
How to make them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Declaring all fields final is not enough

<ul>
<li>
Sufficient for; Strings, primitive types and immutable classes

</ul>
<li>
An immutable class can hide a mutable object by:

<ul>
<li>
Keeping the only reference to this object

<li>
Not modify the object

<li>
Not providing setters

<li>
Declare your class final

<li>
<span id="9th Lecture - Code constructs for security-Immutability in Java-Immutable classes-NB"></span><strong id="NB">NB</strong> any getter for such a hidden object must make a copy of that object!

</ul>
</ul>

<pre java>

final class TimeIntervall {
	public final Instant start;
	public final Instant stop;
	public TimeIntervall(Instant start, Instant stop) {
		if(start.compareTo(stop) &gt;= 0)
			throw new IllegalArgumentException("stop must be after start");
		this.start = start;
		this.stop = stop;
	}
}

<ul>
<li>
Preconditions: Checks assumptions on inputs

<li>
Postconditions: Verifies requirements on the output

</ul>

<div id="9th Lecture - Code constructs for security-Validation-Input Validation"><h3 id="Input Validation" class="header"><a href="#9th Lecture - Code constructs for security-Validation-Input Validation">Input Validation</a></h3></div>
<p>
Different forms of checks on the data:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Size, Lexical, Syntactical, Semantic

</ul>
