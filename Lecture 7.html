<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Access control"><h2 id="Access control" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-Access control">Access control</a></h2></div>
<p>
Basic security concern on any multi-user system: How to control access to objects?
More specifically:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Preventing access

<li>
Limiting access

<li>
Granting access

<li>
Revoking access

</ul>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Access control-Principle of least priviledge"><h3 id="Principle of least priviledge" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-Access control-Principle of least priviledge">Principle of least priviledge</a></h3></div>
<p>
A process/object/user/service... should only have as much priviledge as needed to perform their intended task
</p>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Access control-Access control lists"><h3 id="Access control lists" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-Access control-Access control lists">Access control lists</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
An access control list associates to each object a list who can access the object.

<li>
ACLs is the conventional solution for access control

<li>
<span id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Access control-Access control lists-Example:"></span><strong id="Example:">Example:</strong> File permissions

</ul>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-The confused deputy"><h2 id="The confused deputy" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-The confused deputy">The confused deputy</a></h2></div>
<p>
Typical failure of ACLs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Priviledged process (deputy) is tricked into performing a bad action when acting on behalf of less priviledged process.

<li>
This pattern was identified by Noam Hardy, when thinking about a security hole in a system’s Fortran compiler

</ul>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-The confused deputy-Hardy’s confused deputy"><h3 id="Hardy’s confused deputy" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-The confused deputy-Hardy’s confused deputy">Hardy’s confused deputy</a></h3></div>
<p>
A fortran compiler located in /sysx/fort:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Accessible for all users

<li>
Has special priviledges to /sysx/ to: Write usage statistics to /sysx/stats

<li>
Takes input/output files from command line args

</ul>
<p>
<img src="../vimwiki/INF226_lecture7_pic1" />
<img src="../vimwiki/INF226_lecture7_pic2" />
</p>

<p>
Why did this failure occur?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>fort</em> has legitimate access to /sysx/stats

<li>
Users have to specify input/output files

</ul>
<p>
<em>fort</em> inadvertedly beomes a confused deputy.
How can we solve this?
</p>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-The confused deputy-Ambient authority"><h3 id="Ambient authority" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-The confused deputy-Ambient authority">Ambient authority</a></h3></div>
<p>
Hardy indentifies cause as <span id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-The confused deputy-Ambient authority-ambient authority"></span><strong id="ambient authority">ambient authority</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
An ACL system tries as hard as possible to allow operation using session cookie, UID/GID etc.

<li>
Processes do not have prove their access permit, which is stored in the (ambient) environment.

</ul>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-The confused deputy-Cross-site request forgery: The confused deputy browser"><h3 id="Cross-site request forgery: The confused deputy browser" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-The confused deputy-Cross-site request forgery: The confused deputy browser">Cross-site request forgery: The confused deputy browser</a></h3></div>
<p>
Remember, cross site request forgery is possible when: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
User is logged into site A (with a session cookie).

<li>
Site A will perform actions when the user makes request (send message, transfer money, · · · )

<li>
User visits site B, which makes the browser send requests to site A. (form.send() or &lt;iframe&gt; or &lt;img&gt; or · · · )

</ul>
<p>
In this case the confused deputy is the browser.
</p>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities"><h2 id="Capabilities" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities">Capabilities</a></h2></div>
<p>
A <em>capability</em> consists of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A reference to an object

<li>
A set of permissions for that object

</ul>
<p>
A capability is used whenever a resource is accessed.
Simple to check if an operation is allowed.
<span id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Example:"></span><strong id="Example:">Example:</strong> read(capability)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Reads from the object pointed to by capability

<li>
if capability allows reading.

</ul>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Using capabilities"><h3 id="Using capabilities" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Using capabilities">Using capabilities</a></h3></div>
<p>
Restricting access to programs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Give only the capabilities needed.

<li>
What capabilities should given to:

<ul>
<li>
a word processor?

<li>
a web site?

<li>
a system login manager?

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
This allowes very fine grained applications of the principle of least priviledge.
</p>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Capability properties: Unforgeable"><h3 id="Capability properties: Unforgeable" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Capability properties: Unforgeable">Capability properties: Unforgeable</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
If a capability can be forged, it is useless as a security measure.

<li>
Two approaches to unforgeability:

<ul>
<li>
Enforced by supervisor (operating system, virtual machine, compiler, · · · )

<li>
Unguessable capabilities (random tokens, cryptographic signatures, · · · )

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Enforced by supervisor"><h3 id="Enforced by supervisor" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Enforced by supervisor">Enforced by supervisor</a></h3></div>
<p>
In an OS, the kernel can keep a table of capabilties for each process.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A capability is just an index in the table.

<li>
Since the process cannot access its table, it cannot forge capabilities

<li>
<span id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Enforced by supervisor-Example:"></span><strong id="Example:">Example:</strong> file descriptors on Unix.

</ul>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Unguessable capabilities"><h3 id="Unguessable capabilities" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Unguessable capabilities">Unguessable capabilities</a></h3></div>
<p>
Unguessable capabilities relies on entropy and cryptographic security to prevent forging:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A capability can be referenced by a random number.

<li>
A capability can be signed.

</ul>
<p>
Unguessable capabilities must be used when tranferring capabilities over networks.
</p>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Capability properties: Transferrable"><h3 id="Capability properties: Transferrable" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Capability properties: Transferrable">Capability properties: Transferrable</a></h3></div>
<p>
Capabilities could be transferrable:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If I have a capability, I should be able to transfer it to you.

</ul>
<p>
Capabilities do not care who uses them. Access control is decoupled from identity. This is what prevents possibly confused deputities.
</p>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Example: Hardy’s confused deputy"><h3 id="Example: Hardy’s confused deputy" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Example: Hardy’s confused deputy">Example: Hardy’s confused deputy</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Example: Hardy’s confused deputy-Before:"></span><strong id="Before:">Before:</strong> Fortran compiler takes file names from user.

<li>
<span id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Example: Hardy’s confused deputy-Now:"></span><strong id="Now:">Now:</strong> User transfer their capability for the output file to the fortran compiler.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
When writing ouputs the user given capability is used.

<li>
When writing to /sysx/, the compiler has a separate capabilities.

</ul>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Abstraction"><h3 id="Abstraction" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Abstraction">Abstraction</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Capabilities are described by what you can do with the object (permissions, or interface).

<li>
<span id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Abstraction-Not:"></span><strong id="Not:">Not:</strong> What <span id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Abstraction-is"></span><strong id="is">is</strong> the object.

</ul>

<p>
In principle, the following are treated the same:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The capability of reading from a file.

<li>
The capability of reading from a network connection.

</ul>
<p>
This means capabilities can be a means of abstraction.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Abstraction-Example:"></span><strong id="Example:">Example:</strong> File descriptors in UNIX

</ul>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Enforced by language: Memory safe capabilities"><h3 id="Enforced by language: Memory safe capabilities" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Enforced by language: Memory safe capabilities">Enforced by language: Memory safe capabilities</a></h3></div>
<p>
In a memory safe object capability system can be obtained by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Enforced by language: Memory safe capabilities-endowment:"></span><strong id="endowment:">endowment:</strong> Alice might have intrinsic capabilities given to her at her creation

<li>
<span id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Enforced by language: Memory safe capabilities-creation:"></span><strong id="creation:">creation:</strong> Alice gets capability to access an object she creates.

<li>
<span id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Enforced by language: Memory safe capabilities-introduction:"></span><strong id="introduction:">introduction:</strong> Alice transfers a capability to Bob

</ul>
<p>
This approach relies on the memory safety of the language.
</p>

<p>
<span id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Enforced by language: Memory safe capabilities-Example: banking"></span><strong id="Example: banking">Example: banking</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Bank account capabilities:

<ul>
<li>
Deposit D

<li>
Withdraw W

<li>
Read balance R

</ul>
<li>
Attenuation:

<ul>
<li>
Alice wants Bob to transfer her some money.

<li>
Alice has a (D,W,R) capability to her own account.

<li>
Alice creates a new (D) capability to her account and transfers it to Bob.

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
<span id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Enforced by language: Memory safe capabilities-Example 2: Banking"></span><strong id="Example 2: Banking">Example 2: Banking</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Instead of bank accounts, we could have a capability purse which

</ul>
<p>
references an amount of money.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Anyone can create an empty purse.

<li>
transfer(src,dst,amount) transfers between purses.

</ul>
<li>
When Bob wants to transfer $10 to alice:

<ul>
<li>
Bob creates an empty purse

<li>
Bob transfers $10 from his main purse to new purse.

<li>
Bob sends the purse with $10 to Alice.

<li>
Alice transfers to her main purse.

</ul>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Capability properties: Revokability"><h3 id="Capability properties: Revokability" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Capability properties: Revokability">Capability properties: Revokability</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
The creator of a capability should be able to revoke it.

<li>
Revokation can be temporary, partial.

</ul>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Example: CSRF-tokens as capabilities"><h3 id="Example: CSRF-tokens as capabilities" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Example: CSRF-tokens as capabilities">Example: CSRF-tokens as capabilities</a></h3></div>
<p>
CSRF-tokens can be viewed as capabilities:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Denotes an object (form target) and permission (POST,GET,· · · )

<li>
Unforgeable (unguessable)

</ul>
<p>
Tokens are principle transferrable.
</p>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Capabilities for collaboration"><h3 id="Capabilities for collaboration" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Capabilities for collaboration">Capabilities for collaboration</a></h3></div>
<p>
Capabilities can be useful for collaboration:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Run a program with capabilities to acess shared resources.

</ul>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Universal persistence"><h3 id="Universal persistence" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities-Universal persistence">Universal persistence</a></h3></div>
<p>
Some capability based system feature universal persistence:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Program state remembered, along with capabilities. So that a program is never “restarted”.

<li>
This solves the problem: How are capabilities retained when a program restarts?

<ul>
<li>
When a user logs in, the login manager reconnects them to their running programs.

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities summary"><h2 id="Capabilities summary" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-Capabilities summary">Capabilities summary</a></h2></div>
<p>
A capability consists of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A reference to an object

<li>
A set of permissions for that object

</ul>
<p>
A capability is a unforgeable, transferrable token of authority.
</p>

<div id="7th Lecture - Capability based security-History"><h2 id="History" class="header"><a href="#7th Lecture - Capability based security-History">History</a></h2></div>
<p>
A lot of papers, systems and languages are based on capabilities.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Dennis &amp; van Horn 1966, coined the term “Capability”

<ul>
<li>
Ideas implemented in MIT’s PDP-1

</ul>
<li>
Several systems in the 70’s (GNOSIS, KeyKOS, Cambridge CAP)

<li>
More recently:

<ul>
<li>
E language / Joe-E (Java subset)

<li>
Capsicum (FreeBSD)

<li>
Genode

<li>
Google Fuchsia

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
POSIX capabilities

<li>
Docker capabilties
